Dotfiles
=======
My personal dotfiles + an installer script and a few other fun things.

- bash: A few bash aliases from my pre-zsh times.  Also contains my .profile, which I rely on to set paths and whatnot.
- various: Assorted config files, primarily used for python convenience functions and my pentadactyl(firefox extension) config.
- vim: Where most of my customization has gone.  Note that I use a semi-transparent, fullscreen terminal and so the colors that I use almost certainly look strange in a normal terminal.
- zsh: I use oh-my-zsh with a zshrc full of personalized mappings and a few customzied settings.  Also I use a funky two-line prompt.
- setup.sh: Basic installer.  Touches ~/.dotfiles\_config and ~/.pentadactyl/pentadactylrc for machine specific terminal and browser settings.  Mostly useful if I want to create a work-specific alias or something
